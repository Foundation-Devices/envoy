With Envoy Magic Backups, set up a self custodied Bitcoin mobile wallet in 60 seconds, without seed words!

Passport users can connect their devices to Envoy for easy setup, firmware updates, and a simple Bitcoin wallet experience.",,
What can Envoy do?,"Envoy is a simple Bitcoin wallet with powerful account management and privacy features, including Magic Backups.

Use Envoy alongside your Passport hardware wallet for setup, firmware updates, and more.",,
What is Envoy Magic Backup?,"Magic Backups is the easiest way to set up and back up a Bitcoin mobile wallet. Magic Backups stores your mobile wallet seed end-to-end encrypted in iCloud Keychain or Android Auto Backup. All app data is encrypted by your seed and stored on Foundation Servers. 

Set up your wallet in 60 seconds, and automatically restore if you lose your phone!",,
Do I have to use Envoy Magic Backups?,"Magic Backups are completely optional for users that want to leverage Envoy as a mobile wallet. If you prefer to manage your own mobile wallet seed words and backup file, choose 'Manually Configure Seed Words' at the wallet set up stage.",,
What is the Envoy Backup File?,"The Envoy backup file contains app settings, account info and transaction labels. The file is encrypted with your mobile wallet seed words. For Magic Backup users, this is stored fully encrypted on the Foundation server. 

Manual backup Envoy users can download and store their backup file anywhere they like. This could be any combination of your phone, a personal cloud server, or on something physical like a microSD card or USB drive.",,
Do I need to pay for Envoy?,"No, Envoy’s core features will always be free to use. In the future we may introduce optional paid services or subscriptions.",,
Is Envoy Open Source?,"Yes, like everything we do at Foundation, Envoy is completely open source. Envoy is licensed under the same {GPLv3} license as our Passport Firmware. For those wanting to check our source code, click {here}.",https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html,https://github.com/Foundation-Devices/envoy
Do I have to use Envoy to transact with Passport?,"No, we pride ourselves on ensuring Passport is compatible with as many different software wallets as possible. See our full list, including tutorials {here}.",https://docs.foundationdevices.com/connect,
Do I have to use Envoy to update the firmware on Passport?,"No, anyone is still free to manually download, verify and install new firmware. See {here} for more information.",https://docs.foundationdevices.com/en/firmware-update,
Can I manage more than one Passport with Envoy?,"Absolutely, there is no limit to the number of Passports you can manage and interact with using Envoy.",,
Can I manage multiple accounts from the same Passport?,"Yes, Envoy makes multi-account management simple.",,
How does Envoy communicate with Passport?,"Envoy communicates predominantly via QR codes, however firmware updates are passed from your phone via a microSD card. Passport includes microSD adapters for your phone.",,
Can I use Envoy in parallel to another piece of software like Sparrow Wallet?,"Yes, just be aware that any wallet-specific information, such as address or UTXO labeling, will not be copied to or from Envoy.",,
Can I manage other hardware wallets with Envoy?,"This may be possible as most QR enabled hardware wallets communicate in very similar ways, however this is not explicitly supported. As Envoy is open source, we welcome other QR-based hardware wallets to add support!",,
Is Envoy compatible with the Lightning Network?,At this time Envoy only works with ‘on-chain’ Bitcoin. We plan to support Lightning in the future.,,
What happens if I lose my phone with Envoy installed?,"Anyone finding your phone would first need to get past your phones operating system PIN or biometric authentication to access Envoy. In the unlikely event they achieve this, the attacker could send funds from your Envoy Mobile Wallet and see the amount of Bitcoin stored within any connected Passport accounts. These Passport funds are not at risk because any transactions must be authorized by the paired Passport device.",,
Is Envoy considered ‘Cold Storage’?,"If used with a Passport, Envoy acts as a ‘watch-only’ wallet connected to your hardware wallet. This means Envoy can construct transactions, but they are useless without the relevant authorization, which only Passport can provide. Passport is the 'cold storage' and Envoy is simply the internet connected interface!

If you use Envoy to create a mobile wallet, where the keys are stored securely on your phone, that mobile wallet would not be considered cold storage. This has zero effect on the security of any Passport connected accounts.",,
Can I connect Envoy to my own Bitcoin node?,"Yes, Envoy connects using the Electrum server protocol. To connect to your own Electrum Server, scan the QR or enter the URL provided into the network settings on Envoy.",,
How does Envoy protect my privacy?,"Downloading and installing Envoy requires zero personal information and Envoy can connect to the internet via Tor, a privacy preserving protocol. This means that Foundation has no way of knowing who you are. Envoy also allows more advanced users the ability to connect to their own Bitcoin node to remove any reliance on the Foundation servers completely.",,
Does Envoy offer coin control?,Not yet. We plan to add this as an advanced feature in the near future. ,,
Does Envoy support Batch spends?,At this time Envoy does not support batch spending.,,
Does Envoy allow custom miner fee selection?,"Envoy has two fee settings for the user to choose from when spending, ‘Default’ and ‘Boost’. Default aims to get your transaction finalized within 60 minutes and Boost within 10 minutes. These are estimates based on the network congestion at the time the transaction is built and you will always be shown the cost of both options before finalizing the transaction. Custom fee selection is coming soon.",,
