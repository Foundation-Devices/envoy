This means Envoy can construct transactions, but they are useless without the relevant authorization, which only Passport can provide.

This has zero effect on the security of any Passport connected accounts.",

  "envoy_faq_answer_20": "Downloading and installing Envoy requires zero personal information and Envoy can connect to the internet via Tor, a privacy preserving protocol.

Envoy also allows more advanced users the ability to connect to their own Bitcoin node to remove any reliance on the Foundation servers completely.",
  "envoy_faq_answer_21": "Yes. From version 1.4.0, Envoy now support full coin selection as well as coin 'tagging'.",
  "envoy_faq_answer_22": "At this time Envoy does not support batch spending.",
  "envoy_faq_answer_23": "Yes. From version 1.4.0, Envoy allows for fully customized miner fees as well as two quick select fee options of ‘Standard’ and ‘Faster’. 'Standard' aims to get your transaction finalized within 60 minutes and 'Faster' within 10 minutes. These are estimates based on the network congestion at the time the transaction is built and you will always be shown the cost of both options before finalizing the transaction.",
