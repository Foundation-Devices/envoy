You agree that any dispute, claim, or request for relief relating in any way to your use of Passport will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (a) you may assert claims or seek relief in small claims court if your claims qualify; and (b) you or we may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). This Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all disputes or claims and requests for relief that arose or were asserted before the effective date of this Agreement or any prior version of this Agreement.\r\n\r\n(b) Arbitration Rules and Forum. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your dispute or claim or request for relief to our registered agent. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider. Disputes involving claims, counterclaims, or request for relief under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at https://jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/; all other disputes shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at https://jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/. JAMS’s rules are also available at https://jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS’s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, Company will pay them for you. In addition, Company will reimburse all such JAMS’s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for disputes, claims, or requests for relief totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.\r\n\r\nYou may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n(c) Authority of Arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to (a) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement and (b) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to, any assertion that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Company. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and the Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.\r\n\r\n(d) Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND COMPANY HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and Company are instead electing that all disputes, claims, or requests for relief shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 10(a) (Application of Arbitration Agreement) above. An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would. However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.\r\n\r\n(e) Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief. ALL DISPUTES, CLAIMS, AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this section’s limitations as to a given dispute, claim, or request for relief, then such aspect must be severed from the arbitration and brought into the State or Federal Courts located in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. All other disputes, claims, or requests for relief shall be arbitrated.\r\n\r\n(f) 30-Day Right to Opt Out. You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to: hello@foundationdevices.com, within thirty (30) days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, your Company username (if any), the email address you used to set up your Company account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.\r\n\r\n(g) Severability. Except as provided in Section 10(e)(Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief), if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.\r\n\r\n(h) Survival of Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company.\r\n\r\nModification. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if Company makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, you may reject that change within thirty (30) days of such change becoming effective by writing Company at the following address: Foundation Devices, Inc., 6 Liberty Square #6018, Boston, MA 02109, Attn: CEO.\r\n\r\n19. GENERAL\r\n(a) Changes to Terms of Use. This Agreement is subject to occasional revision, and if we make any substantial changes, we may notify you by sending you an e-mail to the last e-mail address you provided to us (if any) and/or by prominently posting notice of the changes on our website. Any changes to this agreement will be effective upon the earlier of thirty (30) calendar days following our dispatch of an e-mail notice to you (if applicable) or thirty (30) calendar days following our posting of notice of the changes on our website. These changes will be effective immediately for new users of our website. You are responsible for providing us with your most current e-mail address. In the event that the last e-mail address that you have provided us is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you the notice described above, our dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice of the changes described in the notice. Continued use of Passport following notice of such changes will indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions of such changes.\r\n\r\nChoice Of Law. The Agreement is made under and will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act, without giving effect to any principles that provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n(b) Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and us regarding the use of Passport. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in this Agreement are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The word including means including without limitation. If any provision of this Agreement is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of this Agreement will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law. Your relationship to us is that of an independent contractor, and neither party is an agent or partner of the other. This Agreement, and your rights and obligations herein, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without our prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void. The terms of this Agreement will be binding upon assignees.\r\n\r\n(c) Copyright/Trademark Information. Copyright © 2020, Foundation Devices, Inc. All rights reserved.

  "envoy_faq_answer_1": "Envoy is a Bitcoin mobile wallet and Passport companion app, available on iOS and Android.",
  "envoy_faq_answer_10": "No, anyone is still free to manually download, verify and install new firmware. See [[here]] for more information.",
  "envoy_faq_answer_11": "Absolutely, there is no limit to the number of Passports you can manage and interact with using Envoy.",
  "envoy_faq_answer_12": "Yes, Envoy makes multi-account management simple.",
  "envoy_faq_answer_13": "Envoy communicates predominantly via QR codes, however firmware updates are passed from your phone via a microSD card. Passport includes microSD adapters for your phone.",
  "envoy_faq_answer_14": "Yes, just be aware that any wallet-specific information, such as address or UTXO labeling, will not be copied to or from Envoy.",
  "envoy_faq_answer_15": "This may be possible as most QR enabled hardware wallets communicate in very similar ways, however this is not explicitly supported. As Envoy is open source, we welcome other QR-based hardware wallets to add support!",
  "envoy_faq_answer_16": "At this time Envoy only works with ‘on-chain’ Bitcoin. We plan to support Lightning in the future.",
  "envoy_faq_answer_17": "Anyone finding your phone would first need to get past your phones operating system PIN or biometric authentication to access Envoy. In the unlikely event they achieve this, the attacker could send funds from your Envoy Mobile Wallet and see the amount of Bitcoin stored within any connected Passport accounts. These Passport funds are not at risk because any transactions must be authorized by the paired Passport device.",
  "envoy_faq_answer_18": "If used with a Passport, Envoy acts as a ‘watch-only’ wallet connected to your hardware wallet. This means Envoy can construct transactions, but they are useless without the relevant authorization, which only Passport can provide. Passport is the 'cold storage' and Envoy is simply the internet connected interface!If you use Envoy to create a mobile wallet, where the keys are stored securely on your phone, that mobile wallet would not be considered cold storage. This has zero effect on the security of any Passport connected accounts.",
  "envoy_faq_answer_19": "Yes, Envoy connects using the Electrum server protocol. To connect to your own Electrum Server, scan the QR or enter the URL provided into the network settings on Envoy.",
  "envoy_faq_answer_2": "Envoy is designed to offer the easiest to use experience of any Bitcoin wallet, without compromising on your privacy. With Envoy Magic Backups, set up a self custodied Bitcoin mobile wallet in 60 seconds, without seed words!Passport users can connect their devices to Envoy for easy setup, firmware updates, and a simple Bitcoin wallet experience.",
  "envoy_faq_answer_20": "Downloading and installing Envoy requires zero personal information and Envoy can connect to the internet via Tor, a privacy preserving protocol. This means that Foundation has no way of knowing who you are. Envoy also allows more advanced users the ability to connect to their own Bitcoin node to remove any reliance on the Foundation servers completely.",
  "envoy_faq_answer_21": "Yes. From version 1.4.0, Envoy now support full coin selection as well as coin 'tagging'.",
  "envoy_faq_answer_22": "At this time Envoy does not support batch spending.",
  "envoy_faq_answer_23": "Yes. From version 1.4.0, Envoy allows for fully customized miner fees as well as two quick select fee options of ‘Standard’ and ‘Faster’. 'Standard' aims to get your transaction finalized within 60 minutes and 'Faster' within 10 minutes. These are estimates based on the network congestion at the time the transaction is built and you will always be shown the cost of both options before finalizing the transaction.",
  "envoy_faq_answer_3": "Envoy is a simple Bitcoin wallet with powerful account management and privacy features, including Magic Backups.Use Envoy alongside your Passport hardware wallet for setup, firmware updates, and more.",
  "envoy_faq_answer_4": "Magic Backups is the easiest way to set up and back up a Bitcoin mobile wallet. Magic Backups stores your mobile wallet seed end-to-end encrypted in iCloud Keychain or Android Auto Backup. All app data is encrypted by your seed and stored on Foundation Servers. Set up your wallet in 60 seconds, and automatically restore if you lose your phone!",
  "envoy_faq_answer_5": "Magic Backups are completely optional for users that want to leverage Envoy as a mobile wallet. If you prefer to manage your own mobile wallet seed words and backup file, choose 'Manually Configure Seed Words' at the wallet set up stage.",
  "envoy_faq_answer_6": "The Envoy backup file contains app settings, account info and transaction labels. The file is encrypted with your mobile wallet seed words. For Magic Backup users, this is stored fully encrypted on the Foundation server. Manual backup Envoy users can download and store their backup file anywhere they like. This could be any combination of your phone, a personal cloud server, or on something physical like a microSD card or USB drive.",
  "envoy_faq_answer_7": "No, Envoy’s core features will always be free to use. In the future we may introduce optional paid services or subscriptions.",
  "envoy_faq_answer_8": "Yes, like everything we do at Foundation, Envoy is completely open source. Envoy is licensed under the same [[GPLv3]] license as our Passport Firmware. For those wanting to check our source code, click [[here]].",
  "envoy_faq_answer_9": "No, we pride ourselves on ensuring Passport is compatible with as many different software wallets as possible. See our full list, including tutorials [[here]].",
